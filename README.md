This is an online internship offer by 'British Airways,' providing two tasks. Attached are the files for both tasks.


Project Description for "British Airways":

The "British Airways" online project involved two key tasks. In the first task, I conducted web scraping to gather customer comments about the company's services from various sources. The collected data was then carefully cleaned to ensure its accuracy and relevance. Next, I analyzed the reviews and identified the main keywords used by customers to describe their experiences with British Airways. Additionally, I calculated the percentage of positive and negative comments to gauge overall customer satisfaction.

For the second task, I was provided with a dataset and tasked with creating a machine learning model. The primary goal was to develop a predictive model that could forecast future customer behavior for British Airways accurately. Throughout the development process, I paid special attention to feature selection and identification. As a result, I identified the top three features that had the most significant impact on the model's predictions.

The ultimate objective of this project was to enhance British Airways' understanding of customer sentiment and behavior, allowing the company to make informed decisions to improve its services and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
